# Nospz

A project aimed to provide fallback font patches for uncommon CJK unified ideographs.

## Introduction

Nospz is a public-benefit project to create small fallback font patches for websites that have trouble displaying uncommon CJK unified ideographs. The name “Nospz” is derived from “No” + “spz” (the pinyin abbreviation of “生僻字”, uncommon characters).

From large websites to tiny personal blogs, anyone can request a font patch through issues on this repository. I will do my best to accommodate the requests within my ability. This project has currently provided fonts for websites like Moegirlpedia.

In terms of font style, customizations for sans-serif, serif, or other types of fonts are available, with customizations for multiple weights available as well. As long as there is an open-source font of the same type, I will develop these small font patches while following open-source licenses.
