# NospzGothicMoe

A sans-serif fallback font based on [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) designed for [Moegirlpedia](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn).

There is a companion [widget](https://github.com/MoegirlPediaInterfaceAdmins/MoegirlPediaInterfaceCodes/blob/master/src/gadgets/GothicMoe/MediaWiki:Gadget-GothicMoe.css) on the wiki for calling the font.

## Changelog

- 20180808: Initial release, created by Honoka55, named **HonokaGothicMoe**.
    This version required users to download and install the font and modify personal CSS to use. Mobile users could not use it.
- 20181202: First webfont version released.
    This version only required users to modify personal CSS to use and was compatible with all platforms. Due to technical limitations, the font file for this version was placed under the domain of another website.
- 20181216: Addition of CJK characters.
- 20200221: Optimization of strokes, addition and deletion of CJK characters and symbols.
    From this version on, the font file was placed on Moegirl Commons and added to Widget by AnnAngela, and could be enabled directly in Preferences.
- 20200714: Collective production began, renamed to **NospzGothicMoe**. Optimization of strokes, addition of CJK characters and symbols.
    At the same time, the main maintenance users established the MGP Extension Font Group.
- 20200909: Optimization of strokes, addition of CJK characters and hentaigana, deletion of unused CJK characters.
    Since then, Nospz did not require updates for a long time and the main members of the MGP Extension Font Group have launched the “[Plangothic Project](https://github.com/Fitzgerald-Porthmouth-Koenigsegg/Plangothic-Project)” with the goal of completing all CJK characters and using the group directly as Plangothic’s group. The MGP Extension Font Group disappeared, and the Nospz project was continued to be maintained by Honoka55 personally.
- 20210815: Character shapes consistent with the latest version of Plangothic unless there are special circumstances. Optimization of character structure and strokes, addition of CJK characters and kana, completion of missed characters in the previous version.
- 20230215: Some character shapes consistent with the latest version of Plangothic.  Replacement of characters of dubious origin, replacement of mahjong tile characters with [I.Mahjong](https://github.com/SyaoranHinata/I.Mahjong), optimization of character structure and strokes, addition of CJK characters, completion of missed Bopomofo character in the previous version. Characters from [表里](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/表里) not added. Use WOFF2 format (saving space). Update the [abuse filter script for #74](Abuse).

## Reporting Missing Characters
If you have noticed any missing characters on Moegirlpedia, you can report it by replying to [Issue #1](https://github.com/Honoka55/Nospz/issues/1) or editing [this page](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/User:Honoka55/NospzGothicMoe/TODO), and I will update the font periodically to include them. I will also track them through [Abuse Filter #74](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/Special:AbuseFilter/74). Your feedback is appreciated and will help make the font even better.
